# Bank exercise

Completed for AltSource on 11/24/2018

If I was going to keep going, I would:
* Finish unit tests, currently only Account is tested. (It's not a coincidence that that's the only module with all the user input factored out!)
* Clean up the UI for consistency and readability.
* Add a uniqueness constraint for account IDs, (though maybe that wants to wait for a database.)
* Reimplement through a web interface using Vue.js.
